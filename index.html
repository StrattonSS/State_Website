              <h2>About Michigan</h2>
              <p>
                Nestled in the heart of the Great Lakes region, Michigan is the
                only state in the U.S. made up of two separate peninsulas — the
                Upper and Lower — connected by the majestic Mackinac Bridge.
                Surrounded by freshwater on nearly every side, Michigan offers a
                one-of-a-kind landscape where forests, lakes, and vibrant cities
                coexist in perfect balance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The state's economic history is deeply rooted in innovation and
                industry. From the birthplace of the American auto industry in
                Detroit to expansive farmland and bustling tourism hubs,
                Michigan continues to evolve while honoring its proud
                manufacturing legacy.
              </p>
              <p>
                But Michigan isn’t just machines and motors — it’s also music,
                museums, and miles of trails. Whether you’re exploring the
                artisan cafés of Ann Arbor, catching live music in Grand Rapids,
                or wandering the historic streets of Lansing, Michigan offers a
                unique blend of Midwestern charm and forward-thinking energy.

              <h3>Discover Michigan’s Natural Wonders</h3>
              <p>
                Michigan is a paradise for nature lovers. Surrounded by four of
                the five Great Lakes, the state boasts over 3,000 miles of
                freshwater shoreline — more than any other state in the U.S.
                Whether you're strolling a sandy beach or watching the waves
                crash on rocky bluffs, the lakes offer breathtaking views
                year-round.
              </p>
              <p>
                Along the shores of Lake Superior, you’ll find the Pictured
                Rocks National Lakeshore — a spectacular stretch of colorful
                sandstone cliffs, hidden coves, and crystal-clear waters perfect
                for kayaking and hiking. It’s one of the crown jewels of the
                Upper Peninsula.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further inland, Michigan’s natural beauty continues with the
                massive dunes of Sleeping Bear and Silver Lake, where rolling
                hills of golden sand meet forest and shoreline. And don't miss
                the hundreds of waterfalls scattered across the Upper Peninsula,
                from the iconic Tahquamenon Falls to serene hidden cascades
                tucked deep in the woods.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether you're exploring coastal cliffs, forested trails, or
                cascading falls, Michigan’s landscapes offer an unforgettable
                adventure in every season.
